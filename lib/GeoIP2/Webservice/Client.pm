# ABSTRACT: Perl API for the GeoIP2 Precision webservice end points

__END__

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use 5.008;

  use GeoIP2::Webservice::Client;

  my $client = GeoIP2::Webservice::Client->new(
      user_id     => 42,
      license_key => 'abcdef123456',
  );

  my $omni = $client->omni( ip => '24.24.24.24' );

  my $country = $omni->country();
  say $country->iso_code();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a client API for all the GeoIP2 Precision web service's
end points. The end points are Country, City, City/ISP/Org, and Omni. Each end
point returns a different set of data about an IP address, with Country
returning the least data and Omni the most.

Each web service end point is represented by a different model class, and
these model classes in turn contain multiple Record classes. The record
classes have attributes which contain data about the IP address.

If the web service does not return a particular piece of data for an IP
address, the associated attribute is not populated.

The web service may not return any information for an entire record, in which
case all of the attributes for that record class will be empty.

=head1 SSL

Requests to the GeoIP2 Precision web service are always made with SSL.

=head1 USAGE

The basic API for this class is the same for all of the web service end
points. First you create a web service object with your MaxMind C<user_id> and
C<license_key>, then you call the method corresponding to a specific end
point, passing it the IP address you want to look up.

If the request succeeds, the method call will return a model class for the end
point you called. This model in turn contains multiple record classes, each of
which represents part of the data returned by the web service.

If the request fails, the client class throws an exception.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

This class has a single constructor method:

=head2 GeoIP2::Webservice::Client->new()

This method creates a new client object. It accepts the following arguments:

=over 4

=item * user_id

Your MaxMind User ID. Go to https://www.maxmind.com/en/my_license_key to see
your MaxMind User ID and license key.

This argument is required.

=item * license_key

Your MaxMind license key. Go to https://www.maxmind.com/en/my_license_key to
see your MaxMind User ID and license key.

This argument is required.

=item * languages

This is an array reference where each value is a string indicating a
language. This argument will be passed onto record classes to use when their
C<name()> methods are called.

The order of the languages is significant. When a record class has multiple
names (country, city, etc.), its C<name()> method will look at each element of
this array ref and return the first language for which it has a name.

Note that the only language which is always present in the GeoIP2 Precision
data in "en". If you do not include this language, the C<name()> method may
end up returning C<undef> even when the record in question has an English
name.

Currently, the valid list of language codes is:

=over 8

=item * de - German

=item * en - English

English names may still include accented characters if that is the accepted
spelling in English. In other words, English does not mean ASCII.

=item * es - Spanish

=item * fr - French

=item * ja - Japanese

=item * pt-BR - Brazilian Portuguese

=item * ru - Russian

=item * zh-CN - simplified Chinese

=back

Passing any other language code will result in an error.

The default value for this argument is C<['en']>.

=item * host

The hostname to make a request against. This defaults to
"geoip.maxmind.com". In most cases, you should not need to set this
explicitly.

=item * ua

This argument allows you to your own L<LWP::UserAgent> object. This is useful
if you cannot use a vanilla LWP object, for example if you need to set proxy
parameters.

This can actually be any object which supports C<agent()> and C<request()>
methods. This method will be called with an L<HTTP::Request> object as its
only argument. This method must return an L<HTTP::Response> object.

=back

=head1 REQUEST METHODS

All of the request methods accept a single argument:

=over 4

=item * ip

This must be a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address, or the string "me". This is the
address that you want to look up using the GeoIP2 Precision web service.

If you pass the string "me" then the web service returns data on the client
system's IP address. Note that this is the IP address that the web service
sees. If you are using a proxy, the web service will not see the client
system's actual IP address.

=back

=head2 $client->country()

This method calls the GeoIP2 Precision Country end point. It returns a
L<GeoIP2::Model::Country> object.

=head2 $client->city()

This method calls the GeoIP2 Precision City end point. It returns a
L<GeoIP2::Model::City> object.

=head2 $client->city_isp_org()

This method calls the GeoIP2 Precision City/ISP/Org end point. It returns a
L<GeoIP2::Model::CityISPOrg> object.

=head2 $client->omni()

This method calls the GeoIP2 Precision Omni end point. It returns a
L<GeoIP2::Model::Omni> object.

=head1 User-Agent HEADER

This module will set the User-Agent header to include the package name and
version of this module (or a subclass if you use one), the package name and
version of the user agent object, and the version of Perl.

This is set in order to help us support individual users, as well to determine
support policies for dependencies and Perl itself.

=head1 EXCEPTIONS

For details on the possible errors returned by the web service itself, see
http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/web-services for the GeoIP2 Precision web service
docs.

If the web service returns an explicit error document, this is thrown as a
L<GeoIP2::Error::Webservice> exception object. If some other sort of error
occurs, this is thrown as a L<GeoIP2::Error::HTTP> object. The difference is
that the webservice error includes an error message and error code delivered
by the web service. The latter is thrown when some sort of unanticipated error
occurs, such as the web service returning a 500 or an invalid error document.

If the web service returns any status code besides 200, 4xx, or 5xx, this also
becomes a L<GeoIP2::Error::HTTP> object.

Finally, if the web service returns a 200 but the body is invalid, the client
throws a L<GeoIP2::Error::Generic> object.

All of these error classes have an C<< $error->message() >> method and
overload stringification to show that message. This means that if you don't
explicitly catch errors they will ultimately be sent to C<STDERR> with some
sort of (hopefully) useful error message.

=head1 WHAT DATA IS RETURNED?

While many of the end points return the same basic records, the attributes
which can be populated vary between end points. In addition, while an end
point may offer a particular piece of data, MaxMind does not always have every
piece of data for any given IP address.

Because of these factors, it is possible for any end point to return a record
where some or all of the attributes are unpopulated.

See http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/web-services for details on what data each end
point I<may> return.

The only piece of data which is always returned is the C<ip_address> key in
the C<GeoIP2::Record::Traits> record.

Every record class attribute has a corresponding predicate method so you can
check to see if the attribute is set.
